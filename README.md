# HealthInsurancePriceDetector
My project uses Python language and the environment is jupyter notebook
This particular project is based on the regression model of Machine Learning. I have trained my data using LinearRegression,SVR,RandomForestRegression and GradientBoostingRegression. Based on the r2 Score, SVR and RandomForestRegression turned out to be the most accurate one.
The Machine Learning managed to give me a r2 score of 0.96.
Python libraries used:
1)Pandas
2)Numpy
3)Matplotlib
4)scikit learn
I will be working more on building the GUI(on tkinter) will upload the completed file soon.
Data was taken from kaggle
